Dear Smart Methods
first of all, I have used speech to text service and save it as output.txt file (each answer will be saved as file seperatly).Also, I have used text to speech and save it as .mp3 file((each answer will be saved as file seperatly).
Also, I made it as long as the converstion is not finished the chatbot will continue to ask you about my shop.
about task4 subtask 3, I programmed it so the text to speech to text and text to speech services to connect first to be a little faster,
but that did not solve the problem completely
thank you for your time and effort.
regards, 
Alkhazal, Hassan Salman
